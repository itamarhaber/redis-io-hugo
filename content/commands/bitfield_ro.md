Read-only variant of the [BITFIELD](/commands/bitfield) command.
It is like the original [BITFIELD](/commands/bitfield) but only accepts `GET` subcommand and can safely be used in read-only replicas.

Since the original [BITFIELD](/commands/bitfield) has `SET` and `!INCRBY` options it is technically flagged as a writing command in the Redis command table.
For this reason read-only replicas in a Redis Cluster will redirect it to the master instance even if the connection is in read-only mode (see the [READONLY](/commands/readonly) command of Redis Cluster).

Since Redis 6.2, the [BITFIELD_RO](/commands/bitfield_ro) variant was introduced in order to allow [BITFIELD](/commands/bitfield) behavior in read-only replicas without breaking compatibility on command flags.

See original [BITFIELD](/commands/bitfield) for more details.
