Load a script into the scripts cache, without executing it.
After the specified command is loaded into the script cache it will be callable
using [EVALSHA](/commands/evalsha) with the correct SHA1 digest of the script, exactly like after
the first successful invocation of [EVAL](/commands/eval).

The script is guaranteed to stay in the script cache forever (unless `SCRIPT
FLUSH` is called).

The command works in the same way even if the script was already present in the
script cache.

Please refer to the [EVAL](/commands/eval) documentation for detailed information about Redis
Lua scripting.
