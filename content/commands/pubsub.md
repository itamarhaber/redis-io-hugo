The PUBSUB command is an introspection command that allows to inspect the
state of the Pub/Sub subsystem. It is composed of subcommands that are
documented separately. The general form is:

    PUBSUB <subcommand> ... args ...

Cluster note: in a Redis Cluster clients can subscribe to every node, and can
also publish to every other node. The cluster will make sure that published
messages are forwarded as needed. That said, [PUBSUB](/commands/pubsub)'s replies in a cluster only
report information from the node's Pub/Sub context, rather than the entire
cluster.

# PUBSUB CHANNELS [pattern]

Lists the currently *active channels*. An active channel is a Pub/Sub channel
with one or more subscribers (not including clients subscribed to patterns).

If no `pattern` is specified, all the channels are listed, otherwise if pattern
is specified only channels matching the specified glob-style pattern are
listed.

# `PUBSUB NUMSUB [channel-1 ... channel-N]`

Returns the number of subscribers (not counting clients subscribed to patterns)
for the specified channels.

# `PUBSUB NUMPAT`

Returns the number of unique patterns that are subscribed to by clients (that are performed using the
[PSUBSCRIBE](/commands/psubscribe) command). Note that this is not the count of clients subscribed
to patterns but the total number of unique patterns all the clients are subscribed to.
