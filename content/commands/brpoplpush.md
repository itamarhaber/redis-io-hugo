[BRPOPLPUSH](/commands/brpoplpush) is the blocking variant of [RPOPLPUSH](/commands/rpoplpush).
When `source` contains elements, this command behaves exactly like [RPOPLPUSH](/commands/rpoplpush).
When used inside a [MULTI](/commands/multi)/[EXEC](/commands/exec) block, this command behaves exactly like [RPOPLPUSH](/commands/rpoplpush).
When `source` is empty, Redis will block the connection until another client
pushes to it or until `timeout` is reached.
A `timeout` of zero can be used to block indefinitely.

As per Redis 6.2.0, BRPOPLPUSH is considered deprecated. Please prefer [BLMOVE](/commands/blmove) in
new code.

See [RPOPLPUSH](/commands/rpoplpush) for more information.
