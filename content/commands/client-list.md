The [CLIENT LIST](/commands/client-list) command returns information and statistics about the client
connections server in a mostly human readable format.

You can use one of the optional subcommands to filter the list. The `TYPE type` subcommand filters the list by clients' type, where *type* is one of `normal`, `master`, `replica`, and `pubsub`. Note that clients blocked by the [MONITOR](/commands/monitor) command belong to the `normal` class.

The `ID` filter only returns entries for clients with IDs matching the `client-id` arguments.

## Notes

New fields are regularly added for debugging purpose. Some could be removed
in the future. A version safe Redis client using this command should parse
the output accordingly (i.e. handling gracefully missing fields, skipping
unknown fields).
